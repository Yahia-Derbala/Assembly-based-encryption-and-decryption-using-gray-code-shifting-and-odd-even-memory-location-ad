# Assembly-based-encryption-and-decryption-using-gray-code-shifting-and-odd-even-memory-location-ad
The project consists of 3 phases; encryption, decryption, matching. The first phase consists of 3 layers of encryption by first converting the data into gray code, then shifting the memory locations, and finally adding fixed value to odd memory locations and a different value for even locations. The next phase is reversing these steps sequentially. Lastly, a matching function to match and compare between the real input data and the decrypted data to check for errors during encryption.
